# data-engineering-project-azure
Built a scalable ELT pipeline on Azure to process and analyze the AdventureWorks dataset. Data was ingested into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, transformed using Azure Databricks with PySpark, and loaded into Azure Synapse Analytics for querying and reporting. The insights were visualized using Power BI to support sales and operations analysis.
